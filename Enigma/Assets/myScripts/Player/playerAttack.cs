    Player enters an attackstate when click on enemies and destroyable objects (PIVOTALTRACKER)
    The left mousebutton should be the requested input. If the player clicks with LMB on an enemy, movement is disabled
    and enters the attack state. Attack happens only when LMB is pressed and held. Is the player facing the enemy?
